      <p>My name is Luke Smith and I am excited to join the world of coding!</p>

      <p>I moved to Charlotte in 2017 and have loved the city so far.  Originally from a small city, the differences can be striking.</p>

      <p>My personal passions include biking, fitness and nutrition, and rock climbing.  I am interested in meeting new people, making great connections, and building strong trusting relationships in my professional life.</p>
